This is simple concept CRUD operations using JS and Sequelize

Steps
   1.Create a new folder
   2. Open Terminal and run - npm init -y
   3. Now you will create a json file, instead of that json copy my package.json file and install the dependencies
   4. You can take my package file and then run - npm install, now you installed all the dependencies, we can go ahead with the coding now!!!


Create a folder config and inside that configure the js file for database
